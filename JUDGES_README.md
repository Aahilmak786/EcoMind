## 🔍 Technical Deep Dive

### Agent Orchestration:
```python
# Simplified orchestrator logic
class AgentOrchestrator:
    async def coordinate_agents(self):
        # Autonomous decision-making loop
        while self.running:
            environmental_data = await self.get_environmental_state()
            
            # Each agent autonomously processes data
            for agent in self.agents:
                await agent.process_autonomous_cycle(environmental_data)
            
            # Inter-agent communication
            await self.facilitate_agent_communication()
            
            await asyncio.sleep(self.cycle_interval)
```
