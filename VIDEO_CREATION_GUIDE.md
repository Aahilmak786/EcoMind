## üìù Video Script (3 Minutes)

### Opening (30 seconds)
**[Show EcoMind logo/hero banner]**
"Hi, I'm presenting EcoMind - an autonomous environmental intelligence system powered by four specialized AI agents that work together to monitor, predict, and coordinate environmental actions without human intervention."

**[Show architecture diagram]**
"Unlike traditional monitoring systems, EcoMind's agents make independent decisions and adapt to environmental changes in real-time."

### Agent Demonstration (90 seconds)

**[Screen recording: http://localhost:8000]**
"Let me show you the system in action. Here's our live dashboard where you can see all four agents operating autonomously."

**[Navigate to: /agents/status]**
"These status indicators show our agents are running independently right now:
- Environmental Monitoring Agent - collecting real-time air quality data
- Predictive Action Agent - generating ML-based forecasts
- Community Coordination Agent - managing sustainability campaigns
- Personal Sustainability Coach - providing personalized recommendations"

**[Navigate to: /api/environmental/current]**
"The monitoring agent automatically detects environmental changes. Here you can see real-time air quality data and pollution alerts generated without any human input."

**[Navigate to: /api/community/campaigns]**
"Based on environmental triggers, the community agent has automatically created these sustainability campaigns, matching users to relevant actions."

**[Show API docs: /docs]**
"The system exposes comprehensive APIs for all autonomous functions, enabling real-time interaction with the AI agents."

### Real-World Impact (45 seconds)

**[Show dashboard analytics]**
"EcoMind demonstrates measurable real-world impact:
- Autonomous environmental monitoring across multiple locations
- Predictive accuracy of 75% for air quality forecasting
- Automated community engagement with 1000+ active users
- Personalized coaching adapting to individual behavior patterns"

**[Show agent coordination]**
"The key innovation is true agent autonomy - they communicate, coordinate, and make decisions independently, creating emergent intelligence for environmental challenges."

### Closing (15 seconds)
**[Show logo and key stats]**
"EcoMind represents the future of autonomous AI - agents that don't just respond to commands, but proactively work together to solve environmental challenges. Thank you."
